# Keeping identity graphs in sync with Apache Spark

Presentation I ([@berenguel](https://twitter.com/berenguel)) gave at the [Data Love Conference](https://datalove.konfy.care) on April 2021
to explain how we manage a 2 billion node graph at [Hybrid Theory](https://www.hybridtheory.com). You can find the slides
[here](https://github.com/rberenguel/identity-graphs/releases/download/0.1.0/identity-graphs.pdf)
(some images might look slightly blurry). I recommend you check the version with
[presenter
notes](https://github.com/rberenguel/identity-graphs/releases/download/0.1.0/identity-graphs-with-notes.pdf)
which is only available here. You can also head over the _releases_ tab in case I have a more recent version and forgot to update this README.

If you want additional information about Spark in general, I gave an
`introduction to Spark` talk with [Carlos Pe√±a](http://twitter.com/crafty_coder)
that you can find [here](https://github.com/rberenguel/WelcomeToApacheSpark).
